## Description
jQuery is a JavaScript Library. jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming. jQuery is easy to learn. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
This webpage applies the different styles I have learnt in jQuery to play around with html and css elements.

## Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
